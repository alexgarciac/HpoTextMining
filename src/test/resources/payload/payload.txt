Our case is a 24-year-old male born to consanguineous Yemeni parents. He was healthy at birth and as a baby he achieved normal developmental milestones. By three years of age, he started
to have difficulties during walking and developed progressive knee deformities. Rapidly over several years, he started to develop progressive symmetric joint pain, stiffness and swelling.
The first joint involved were the knees followed by hips, elbows and hand joints. The pain involved almost all joints, but more severe in hips and lower back. The patient was used to take
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) irregularly in the case of severe pain, but he has never been on steroid therapy. There were no symptoms of numbness or tingling in the
extremities and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. He exhibited a flexed posture in the trunk and extremities and abnormal gait (Figure 1A and supplemental video S1). We found enlargement
of joints, which were more prominent in the interphalangeal, elbow and knees joints (Figure 1 A, B), but there were no signs of inflammation such as tenderness or redness. Movements of
all joints were extremely restricted, including neck, spine, shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle and interphalangeal joints of hands and feet. The mental status, vision, hearing
and speech were normal.
